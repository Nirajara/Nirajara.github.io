Indoor archery, <a href="https://www.betweenends.com/tournament/1136/">SIACC 2023</a>, is organized by the <a href="https://sgaalumni.org/siacc">SGA Alumni Association</a>. Targets are 40 cm (diameter) and we are shooting at a distance of 20 meters. The tournament here is round robin style where we go one-on-one with another archer or team. I was placed in the top flight as a result of the qualifier competitions (I participated in the <a href="https://www.betweenends.com/tournament/1123/">UCLA</a> and <a href="https://www.betweenends.com/tournament/1126/">UCI</a> qualifiers). I ended the tournament with 3 wins, placing third in my flight!
